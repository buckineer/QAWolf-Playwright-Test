1. Why do you want to work at QA Wolf? (Script)

Hello
This is Addison Whitney from Grand Rapids, MI.
Iâ€™m excited to share why I want to work at QA Wolf. First and foremost, I am deeply impressed by QA Wolf's mission to help teams ship confidently by automating QA with zero effort. Quality assurance is a critical aspect of software development, and I have seen and experienced firsthand how challenging it can be to ensure that automated tests are reliable and efficient. QA Wolf's innovative approach to solving these problems is something I am genuinely passionate about.

I have over 8 years of experience in software development and quality assurance, and during my time at Security Snares, Inc., I played a pivotal role in creating and maintaining automated tests using tools like JavaScript and Playwright. This experience has given me a solid understanding of the importance of a robust QA process, and I am eager to bring my skills and knowledge to QA Wolf.

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, I have been working 100% remotely, and I have found that this arrangement significantly improves my productivity and work-life balance. I am thrilled that QA Wolf offers a fully remote position, as it aligns perfectly with my preferred working style.

What truly excites me about QA Wolf is the company's commitment to growth and development. When I saw your career path and the opportunities for advancement, I felt a strong desire to be part of this journey. I am attracted to the idea of working at a company that values continuous improvement and innovation, and I am confident that I can contribute to QA Wolf's success while growing professionally.

Thank you for listening to the end. I am excited about the possibility of contributing to QA Wolf and being part of a team.
